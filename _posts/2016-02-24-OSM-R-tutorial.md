Today I had the pleasure of presenting a talk about R during one of the tutorial sessions at the AGU Ocean Sciences Meeting in New Orleans. I made a deliberate point of saying that my main message was more like: "R is really cool, and here's why", rather than: "You should all stop using Matlab". Being divisive doesn't help anybody work better.

I was quite surprised at the number of people who raised their hand when I asked if they use R as their main analysis tool -- perhaps about a third of the (surprisingly full) room! 

Anyway, see below for the pdf of my talk and the `Rnw` source file. Note that the `Rnw` has links to some external images so you won't be able to `knitr()` it for yourself, but feel free to use the slide content.
